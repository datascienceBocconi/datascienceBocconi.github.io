# Section 1


## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. 

To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. 

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

# Case studies

## Case study 1: IMDb dataset

![](https://datasciencebocconi.github.io/Images/text_mining/imdb.png)

## Case study 1: IMDb dataset

The Internet Movie Database ([IMDb](https://www.imdb.com)) is a popular website for film reviews.

 - Can we automatically identify the **sentiment** of a review?
 - Can we predict the **IMDb rating** of a film, based on its reviews?

There are also a lot of practical problems:

  - How do we **pre-process** and **clean** the data?
  - How do we **convert words into numbers**?

## Case study 2: sales price prediction

![](https://datasciencebocconi.github.io/Images/casestudy_housing/housesbanner.png){width=100%}

What is the right **price** for a **house** in Ames, Iowa?

In statistical terms: can you **predict** the final price based on the characteristic of the house?

This is a **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)** playground competition.  You will be asked to join the competition along with other thousands of players!

## Case study 3: the data challenge

The dataset will be disclosed at the kick-off date!

Your goal will be to construct a model which has good predictive performance.
